Advent-of-Code-2020
This is my first AOC and also first serious (fun) coding in many years.
I used to be a C/C++ programmer in the 90's but drifted away over time.
Feels good to be picking up programming again, hope you enjoy my attempts.
I at least enjoyed noticing that my skills somehow improved over the days ;)
As the assignments were (for me) getting increasingly harder I had to cheat 
with assignment 11 and 14 by checking out some AOC Haskell clips on YouTube,
making notes and use them to build my code. Hopefully next year that won't
be necessary anymore.
