Advent-of-Code-2020
This is my first AOC and also first serious (fun) coding in many years
I used to be a C/C++ programmer in the 90's but drifted away over time
Feels good to be picking up programming again, hope you enjoy my attempts
I at least enjoyed noticing that my skills somehow improved over the days ;)
