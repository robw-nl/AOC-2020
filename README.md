# Advent-of-Code-2020
# This is my first AOC and also first serious (fun) coding in many years
# I used to be a C/C++ programmer in the 90's but drifted away over time
# Glad to be picking it up again, hop you enjoy reading my attempts
# I at least enjoyed noticing that my skills somehow improved over the days ;)
